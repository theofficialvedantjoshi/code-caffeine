Course Description: This course is focused on digital literacies for engineers and will
equip students with the ability to apply a problem-solving meth-
odology to common engineering problems. Using a problem-
based approach, students will develop the skills to design, write,
test and debug programmes that improve the world we live in.
They will be presented with various types of engineering prob-
lems which they will then work through from problem identifica-
tion and algorithm design through to the implementation phase.
As part of this course, they will also be introduced to the syntax
and development environment of the engineering software tool
MATLAB/Simulink. This course establishes a foundation for en-
gineering programmes that require advanced programming and
problem-solving skills such as Electrical & Electronic, Computer
& Network, Mechatronic and Automotive Engineering.
