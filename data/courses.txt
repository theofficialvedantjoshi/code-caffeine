Description: This course is focused on digital literacies for engineers and will
equip students with the ability to apply a problem-solving meth-
odology to common engineering problems. Using a problem-
based approach, students will develop the skills to design, write,
test and debug programmes that improve the world we live in.
They will be presented with various types of engineering prob-
lems which they will then work through from problem identifica-
tion and algorithm design through to the implementation phase.
As part of this course, they will also be introduced to the syntax
and development environment of the engineering software tool
MATLAB/Simulink. This course establishes a foundation for en-
gineering programmes that require advanced programming and
problem-solving skills such as Electrical & Electronic, Computer
& Network, Mechatronic and Automotive Engineering.

Various aspects like structure, properties, therapeutic and phar-
maceutical importance, mechanism of action, S.A.R. and me-
tabolism of drugs and the uses of drug molecules both of natural
and synthetic origin will be covered. Special emphasis will be
given to topics such as Anti-hypertensive drugs, Anti-diabetic
drugs, Steroids and steroidal drugs, Antimalarial drugs, Anti-
cancer agents, Antiviral agents, Antiprotozoals, Antihelmintics,
etc. Concepts of QSAR approach to drug design, molecular
modelling, and combinatorial chemistry will also be discussed in
addition. Principles of Toxicology.
